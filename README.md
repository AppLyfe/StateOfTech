 <h2 align="center">Purpose</h1>
South Florida is a growing tech center By creating visualizations of it's current
state we can help analyze areas of strength and weakness. This site
will be a living representation of the tech ecosystem and we want to have it
be a resource to inform technologists and enthusiasts on strength weakness and
how to contribute to bettering the system.
